# C++ Arithmetic Expression Interpreter

This is a simple C++ program that interprets and evaluates basic arithmetic expressions, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program uses a stack-based approach to parse and evaluate expressions, following standard operator precedence rules.

## Features

- **Arithmetic Expressions**: Supports `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`.
- **Operator Precedence**: Handles multiplication and division before addition and subtraction.
- **Stacks**: Uses two stacks, one for values (numbers) and one for operators, to evaluate expressions.
- **Whitespace Handling**: Ignores any whitespace in the input expression.
  
## How It Works

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads an arithmetic expression from the user.
2. **Expression Evaluation**: It uses two stacks:
   - A `values` stack to store numbers.
   - An `ops` stack to store operators.
3. **Operator Precedence**: The program evaluates multiplication and division before addition and subtraction.
4. **Final Calculation**: Once all tokens (numbers and operators) have been processed, the program outputs the result.

## Compilation and Running

To compile and run the program, follow these steps:

### 1. Save the code to a file

Save the provided C++ code to a file, e.g., `interpreter.cpp`.

### 2. Compile the code

You can use `g++` (GNU C++ compiler) to compile the program.

```bash
g++ interpreter.cpp -o interpreter
